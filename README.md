# Python OOP Project

This Python project answers 5 object-oriented programming questions using clean code, Filipino names and scenarios, and all required OOP concepts. The program is split into multiple files for readability and modularity.

## üí° Project Overview

**Required OOP Implementations:**
- ‚úÖ OOP principles
- ‚úÖ Encapsulation
- ‚úÖ Inheritance
- ‚úÖ Polymorphism (via Inheritance)
- ‚úÖ Abstraction (via abstract base class)
- ‚úÖ Methods: instance, class, static

**Optional Concepts Included:**
- ‚úÖ Aggregation
- ‚úÖ Composition
- ‚úÖ Nested Class
- ‚úÖ Dunder Methods (`__add__`, `__str__`)

## üìå Problem Breakdown & File Summary

| Question | Topic | File(s) | Concepts Used |
|---------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Is a school bus a Vehicle? | `vehicle.py` | Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation |
| 2 | Employee with multiple constructors | `employee.py` | Class Method, Encapsulation |
| 3 | SchoolOne and SchoolTwo student GPA | `school.py` | Aggregation, Static Method, Inheritance |
| 4 | Vector class with `+` operator | `vector.py` | Dunder Method, Polymorphism |
| 5 | Book class using Author class (composition over inheritance) | `book.py` | Composition, Nested Class |

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How To Run

Make sure all `.py` files are in the same folder, then run:

```bash
python main.py
This will:

Start a Bus (Vehicle test)
Display Employees using multiple constructors
Show student GPAs from two different schools
Add two vectors using +
Display book and author with a nested chapter
